## üåü Project Overview
Welcome to the ultimate Smart Home Safety Squad! This repo simulates a **fire/smoke/flame/CO detection** system using Cisco Packet Tracer and Python. Our goal? To detect danger early, alert the user with some sass, and maybe save your house ‚Äî or at least your favorite snack stash.

## What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Cisco Packet Tracer simulation files** (`.pkt`) ‚Äî Build your own smart home IoT network featuring sensors, gateways, and MQTT brokers.  
- **Python scripts** ‚Äî Simulate sensor data, run detection algorithms, and sound hilarious alarms that‚Äôll make you chuckle while you evacuate.  
- **Architecture diagrams** ‚Äî Because who doesn‚Äôt love pretty pictures of networks?  
- **Project report** ‚Äî Deep dive into methodology, security considerations, and future directions.

## How It Works: The Smart Smell Test üëÉ

1. Sensors (fire, smoke, CO) constantly sniff the air.  
2. Data is sent to a central IoT Gateway (simulated in Cisco).  
3. Python scripts analyze sensor data for dangerous thresholds.  
4. If danger is detected, alerts trigger with a cheeky message AND a real emergency notification.

## Getting Started

### Cisco Packet Tracer Setup

- Open `cisco/smart_home_fire_iot_simulation.pkt` (coming soon!)  
- Devices include smart smoke detectors, CO sensors, smart lights, and the central gateway router.  
- Configure sensors using `configs/sensor_config.txt`.  
- Gateway config available at `configs/gateway_config.txt`.

> **Pro tip:** Sensors talk MQTT, so configure your broker accordingly!

### Python Simulation

```python
cd python
python3 fire_smoke_co_detector.py
---

---

## Step 2: Python Code ‚Äî `fire_smoke_co_detector.py`



"""
fire_smoke_co_detector.py

Simulates sensor readings for fire, smoke, and CO levels and triggers alerts.
Because a smart home without sass is just a boring home.
